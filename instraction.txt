﻿﻿A running SSH service you are authorised to test (such as on your localhost) is required to test this script.

Note that the default Kali SSH configuration will block authentication attempts after 10 attempts (MaxStartups 10:30:10).

If you want to test 100 connections + the valid password using the above wordlist,
 you will need to edit your sshd_config (for example, by setting MaxStartups 101) and restarting the service.
 Alternatively to test, use a wordlist with less than 10 invalid passwords.
